        <question>Please provide a brief abstract describing this dataset.</question>
        <answer>The present dataset was created for machine learning in order to improve the prediction of bloodstream infections. The dataset combines clinical blood parameters, age, sex as well as previous admissions to blood culturing results (negative and positive) over a period of more than 10 years.</answer>

        <main>
            <question>Please state, in detail, the main hypothesis for which this dataset was created.</question>
            <answer>Bloodstream infections (BSI) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality (mortality rates up to 30%) with increasing incidence. At Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, 40,000 blood culturing flasks are sampled every year when suspecting BSI. Of these, only 10% are true positives and 10% contain contaminants, often skin flora, i.e. prediction of BSI is poor. While samples are cultured for identification of pathogens, broad empirical antibiotic treatment (BEAT) is initiated, which increases risk of antimicrobial resistance and subsequent acquisition of multidrug resistant pathogens. When culturing is finalized days after sampling BEAT is changed to a narrow treatment to specifically target the identified pathogen. More precise prediction of BSI-positive patients including identification of the infecting pathogen and application of more precise treatment few hours after suspicion of BSI would be of great advantage for all patients with increased survival, less development of resistance, fewer side effects and be economically beneficial for the hospital. The aim is to determine explanatory factors for prediction of BSI by employing machine learning and ultimately to apply this knowledge for developing an AI-based clinical application which can predict bloodstream infections from clinical parameters which are measured right upon admission. The present dataset contains: -Positive and negative blood culturing results of vira, bacteria and fungi; -Patient age and Sex; -previous admissions (departments, dates); -diagnoses; -biochemical blood-analyses (electrolytes, glucose, creatinine, infection parameters [leukocytes, CRP, procalcitonin], eGFR and liver enzymes).</answer>
